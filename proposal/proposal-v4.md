# Thesis Proposal

On May 13, 1950, Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli, and Reg Parnell took first, second, and third (collectively the podium), in the first World Championship Formula One race at the Silverstone Circuit in England. Sixty-eight years, 11 months, and one day later, on April 14, 2019, five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton took first at the 1000th Formula One race, the 2019 Chinese Grand Prix. Over the course of the 998 races that separate these victories, Formula One has changed significantly. From a small set of races primarily in Europe, drivers have gone on to race on six continents. New materials and technology have helped pushed the design of the cars forward, creating machines that go faster on the straights and in the corners. The untimely deaths of drivers like Ayrton Senna and Jules Bianchi have brought forth improvements in driver safety.

For my master's project I want to explore interactive data visualizations. Through my graduate coursework I've had the opportunity to explore different disciplines and media. Of the work I've done, I've most enjoyed synthesizing different media and creating things that allow for learning through exploration and interaction.

For this project, I want to create a visual history of the sport from 1950 to the present day. I'm primarily interested in analyzing and presenting how the design of the cars has changed over time and how that has affected the sport. As regulations evolved and new materials and technology were brought in, car bodies evolved from the torpedo or pipe like shape of the Alfa Romeo 158 to the distinct sleek car with the series of wings and fins to control and harness air flow. Engines have fluctuated in size and power and even now the cars incorporate electric power to get through the races. Along the way, teams tried new ways to navigate the rules and get the advantage on other teams racing. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, the [Brabham BT46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukIEuzgd3U) featured a fan that would suck the air under the car to produce more downforce. In the early 90s, the Williams FW15C featured [active suspension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AME4v3qZkc) and traction control which gave Alain Prost an extra edge over the drivers, and helped Prost achieve his fourth World Championship. The use of electronic driver aids was banned at the end of the season, but the car had made its mark in the sport by that point.

Before arriving at the cars, I had been considering creating an interactive timeline of the sport, going race by race and adding callouts and links to media to make. Using race data gathered from the [Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/), I built a rough [prototype](http://lennymartinez.com/vis-thesis/prototype/line-chart-all.html) that plotted every race from the 1950 British Grand Prix to the 2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, and a line for every driver's finishing positions over their career. Through making this I came to understand how messy it might be to create an annotated timeline with every driver's career on it. Ultimately, I think working with the cars will provide a more direct connection to the sports because it focuses on a specific physical part of the races.

## Previous Work

Looking back at my coursework, I think these projects made during and shortly after I left Syracuse highlight my progress:

My [first data-driven project](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3bp65gt2y2wtbet/AACzRk4bMA22OYy6PSqOuvLpa?dl=0) was a series of prints where I used text-messages I had exchanged with friends as the "pixels" in out photographs: the closer you got to the print, the less of the overall image you could see and the better you could read the messages.

My second data-driven project was an attempt to tell the story of my last relationship through our text messages, looking at the emotional strength of each message and also at our word choices over three different weeks.

My [third data-driven project](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiNgylbgKCq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) was an animation about all the different fire alarms that had gone off on Euclid Street in Syracuse, a popular street for students to live on, during my academic year at Syracuse.

My fourth, and most recent, data-driven project was my work with News21 during our investigation, Hate in America. As part of the investigation I created the interactive piece, [The State of Hate](https://hateinamerica.news21.com/roadtrip/),that summarized and presented our findings from a cross-country road trip I was a part of. I also researched and created an internal database of all the federally prosecuted hate crimes in the last 9 years, which helped others in the newsroom learn and find leads for their stories.

## Project Outcomes

The main outcome of this project will be the interactive visualization and an accompanying write up of the process that will exist as a stand-alone package. I'll also be creating a conference-style talk where I go over the project, the process of making it, and what I've learned, and present that both to the committee and to the audience on the day of the defense as a second outcome. Both outcomes will then be added as part of a redesigned portfolio.

As I get further along, I'll be working to pitch the project to digital publications like The Pudding in the hopes that it can be later published to a wider audience. The time right when I plan to publicly defend, August 7, is at the start of Formula One's summer break and it might be a good time to publish such a piece ahead of the Grand Prix the last weekend of August.

## Student Learning

As a graduate student I've worked to combine my technical background with my studies in communications. I have explored different disciplines and media: virtual reality, augmented reality, 360º videos, graphic design, photography, picture editing, data journalism, product design, and data visualization. I've come to realize how much I enjoy gathering and synthesizing different media and data to produce a piece and also creating things that allow for learning through exploration. This project will allow me to do more of these two things.

By working on this project, I'll also be able to build a stronger web programming core, working with Javascript and D3 to create the interactive piece. Illustration and motion graphics will likely play a part in the project too, so I'll be learning more about those; I worked on animating [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3foEvxBnh7o) last fall.

I’ll also be looking into learning more about the engineering and design topics related to Formula One cars like aerodynamics and computational modeling. I've been considering getting a second master's degree or a PhD in computational engineering + design.
