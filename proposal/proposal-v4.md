# Thesis Proposal

For my master's project I want to explore interactive data visualizations. As a graduate student I've worked to combine my technical background with my communications studies. I have explored different disciplines and media: virtual reality, augmented reality, 360ยบ videos, graphic design, picture editing, data journalism, product design and data visualization. And I have realized how much I enjoy working on creating things that allow for learning through exploration and interaction. That said, I'm not happy with most of the projects I've produced until now and want to use my master's project to create a body of work that is more reflective of my skills.

My [first data-driven project](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3bp65gt2y2wtbet/AACzRk4bMA22OYy6PSqOuvLpa?dl=0) was a series of prints where I used text-messages I had exchanged with friends as the "pixels" in out photographs: the closer you got to the print, the less of the overall image you could see and the better you could read the messages.

My second data-driven project was an attempt to tell the story of my last relationship through our text messages, looking at the emotional strength of each message and also at our word choices over three different weeks.

My [third data-driven project](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiNgylbgKCq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) was an animation about all the different fire alarms that had gone off on Euclid Street in Syracuse, a popular street for students to live on, during my academic year at Syracuse.

My fourth, and most recent, data-driven project was my work with News21 during our investigation, Hate in America. As part of the investigation I created the interactive piece, [The State of Hate](https://hateinamerica.news21.com/roadtrip/),that summarized and presented our findings from a cross-country road trip I was a part of. I also researched and created an internal database of all the federally prosecuted hate crimes in the last 9 years, which helped others in the newsroom learn and find leads for their stories.

From these projects I have learned different techniques for analyzing data, and how to structure a story that's found in data. For my master's project I want to take everything I've learned working on these projects and produce three interactive data visualizations that are of similar quality to my News21 The State of Hate piece.

## Making the visualizations

For this project I will follow a process similar to the one used by Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu in their [Data Sketches](http://www.datasketch.es/about/) collaboration. For the next three months, I will pick a topic every month and create a visualization around it. I will work to spend one week gathering and preparing data, another week sketching and ideating the visualization, and the last two weeks of the month executing and creating the visualization. I will document my progress through each visualization in a digital journal. 

I will start with the one I know for sure I want to work with, Formula 1. For one of the visualizations I'm looking to collaborate with the photo collective American Reportage on their first group project, but still don't know what topic they have decided. They were in between stories looking ahead to the 2020 census and stories around what happens when a local Wal-mart closes. I had been thinking of doing my third visualization as a redesign of an existing one, [carboncounter.com](http://carboncounter.com), but I've yet to hear back from the folks who made it about some questions I had with the data and how they analyzed it. As I better define the topics I will update this section with more details.

## Project Outcomes

The main outcome of the project will be the three individual visualizations and their accompanying write-ups. I want to incorporate them both in a stand-alone website for the master's project and as part of a redesigned portfolio. In addition I want to take the visualizations and the write-ups and create a conference-style talk where I go over the project and what I learned as an outcome. This talk would be what I present on the day of the defense.
