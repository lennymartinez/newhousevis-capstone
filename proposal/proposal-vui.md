# Master's Proposal

Imagine this routine: your alarm goes off at 5:30 sharp. You get out of bed and into the shower. The water’s just the right temperature, and as you get out the shower, a pot in the kitchen begins brewing coffee. When you reach to the kitchen, the coffee is ready for you to drink in your favorite mug. Mug in hand, you head from the kitchen to an adjacent room where you faintly hear music playing. It’s a Pink Martini playlist. As you settle into your chair to drink your coffee, the only thing that’s changed in the room is the light on the device on the coffee table. It’s gone from blue to a lime green. As you drink your coffee, songs play uninterrupted and time passes. Once you’ve had your fill of coffee, you set your mug down and without thinking twice speak to the empty room,

“Good morning, Charlie. What’s kind of news do you have for me today?”

The music that was playing before fades quickly as a new sound takes its place.

“Good morning. I’ve got technology, business, politics, and tennis this morning. Where would you like to start?”

“Technology. Anything interesting related to blockchain?” 

“There hasn’t been anything new since yesterday about blockchain, but John Underkoffler gave a talk at  Games Beat Summit recently about UI. Karim Ben Khelifa also gave an interview to Creative Planet Network about “The Enemy”.”

“Can you save Karim’s interview for later? Let’s start with the UI talk.”

“Sure, I’ll pass it to your Pocket. There’s a video of the talk, do you want me to play it on the TV for you?”

“Yes, but lower the volume. The kids are still sleeping.”

The TV turns on, Charlie’s voice disappears and the video plays. Halfway through the video you glance at your phone and realize that it’s time for you to head to work. With a tap on your phone, the video is paused and saved for later. You wash the mug in the kitchen sink and head off to work. 

For my master’s project, I want to explore how people experience the news. Up until now, it has been a largely passive process of taking in information from different sources, whether it be listening to the radio, reading the paper, or watching television, and moving on to doing other things. The act of processing and relating events to each other is left to the viewer and often not emphasized as an important part of understanding the news. Charlie is the idea for a new way of experiencing the news that allows for active engagement with the news through both sound and visuals. By using audio as the main way to interact with the news, I want to tap into one of the oldest ways of communicating, speech, to create a more engaging way to experience the news. 

The technology for using voice to interact with the world isn’t new— the first functional speech recognition system was the IBM Shoebox in 1962 that could do arithmetic. Since then, things have advanced significantly. We’ve developed systems that notify us of store hours, handle voice mails, give us flight information and more recently, act as personal digital assistants (Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google’s Assistant.) That said, the technology behind voice interactions has not yet fully matured, and the result is a lack of connection with the voice we’re supposed to be working with.

These digital assistants currently come the closest to my vision of what Charlie would be like, but they also lack the ability to understand context in terms of space and  people who may be around the user. They don’t fully understand the difference between office and home and what’s appropriate to say when there are a lot of people around or when there is nobody around. There is a growing field of computing that is working on this type of understanding called Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The ability to understand context will be a key component of how Charlie will work. 

In terms of deliverables, I will create a voice prototype built to work with Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant as the main goal, a series of 360 videos showing what interactions with Charlie look like over a day and in different settings, and a case study book detailing the process and research that’s gone into Charlie along with any user interviews, usability testing.
