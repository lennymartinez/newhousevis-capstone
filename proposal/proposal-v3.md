# Master's Project

For my master's project I want to create a series of data visualizations to be the starting point of my portfolio moving forward. As a graduate student at Syracuse I've worked on different efforts to explore the field of communications in search of a niche. I've learned about telling stories with still images and how to help someone edit their work. I've learned to make videos, photogrammetry models, and small-scale AR & VR experiences. I’ve also been trying to learn what kind of tools journalists could use and through that I’ve discovered the fields of data journalism and data visualization.

I want to focus on data visualization because it's offered me the best oppotunity to combine my engineering background, with my interests in graphic design and communications to work with data and make sense of the world for others. To date, I've worked on three small projects that were data-driven:

* Correspondence: I created a series of photo prints where I used text messages as the "pixels" of images. From far you could make the image quite clearly, but only once you got close to the image could you read the conversations between myself and different friends. This was definitely data art.

* Correspondence with Bethany: In a series of 9 graphics I tried to chart the progression of one my relationships through the text messages we sent each other. 

* Fire Alarms on Euclid Avenue: I worked with data another student had gathered to create an animation of all the fire alarms that had gone off on Euclid Avenue, a street of Syracuse, New York, where a large number of students who went to Syracuse University lived during the 2017–2018 academic year. 

Though I think each of these projects has helped me learn more about how to work with data, I want to push myself to further explore the practice of data visualization and create a portfolio of work that could help me get a job in a newspaper graphics desk or in a data visualization studio. To achieve this I will on three different efforts: redesigning an existing visualization; creating a visualization for someone else; and, creating a visualization on something I care about.
