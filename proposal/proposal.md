Frame this as a culmination of growth and path-finding to create

A data visualization is a display of data designed to enable analysis, exploration, and discovery… [They] are often conceived as tools that let people extract their own conclusions from the data. (*The Truthful Art*, page 31)

Data visualization

# Master's Proposal

During my time as a student at Syracuse University I've worked to find my niche in the world of communications. I began in photography because I was interested in learning more about making images and documenting the world around me. As I worked through the summer boot camp semester, I slowly came to realize I was more interested in cataloging the world than in telling stories. Understanding this I still set out to learn how to tell stories with images, but I also set out to explore other areas where I could use my engineering skills in the field of communications. 

I explored different immersive media: virtual reality, augmented reality, and 360º videos. I took a class on studying trends in the tech and media industries and learned about voice-user interfaces. I learned about picture editing and tried to learn more about graphic design. I tried to learn more about the kinds of tools journalists could use and was lead to learning about data journalism, and through that, data visualization.

My explorations culminated in two large projects last year: the News21 Hate in America Investigation, and my job as a teaching assistant for the product design class I took before I started at Syracuse. 

Through my work on the Hate in America Investigation I was able to immerse myself in a newsroom. I got to test my technical skills and work on improving them while doing research and reporting on federal cases related to hate-crime laws. I got the opportunity to build my social skills and confidence by doing man-on-the-street interviews during our road trip across western America. I learned how to build an interactive piece and how to collect and organize data. 

Through my job as a teaching assistant I was able to learn more about design and doing media work in a fast-paced environment. We made photos and shot video during every class-related activity (lecture, milestones, lab sessions, tutorials) and I had to work daily to create slide shows that encapsulated the activity and were timely. We also planned and prepared materials and demos for each of the three lectures every week. I learned to make animations and picked up a few more machining skills. It was exhausting, but very exciting work. Working with the class also provided a backdrop for me to measure how much I'd grown and reflect on my explorations.

In searching for my niche I've learned about  virtual and augmented reality, made a 360º video, written about the future of voice-user interfaces, learned about picture editing, and tried to learn more about graphic design. I also tried to learn more about the kinds of tools journalists have and use and through this encountered data journalism and data visualization. 

On top of my school-centered explorations, I had the opportunity to be an investigative fellow for News21's Hate in America project. I learned more about working with data: how to collect, analyze, and report with it. I learned how to build an interactive web piece, and I got the chance to work on some of the infographics. I also built reporting skills while doing man-on-the-street interviews in English and Spanish.

I also had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for a product design capstone class, where I constantly rotated between making pictures, editing pictures, shooting video, mentoring teams, and preparing demos and activities for lecture.

In the past two years I ended up wearing a lot of different hats. 
While looking for my niche, I've worn different hats, but now I want to consolidate my experiences around the two disciplines I've most strongly connected with: data visualization and product design.

In his book, *The Truthful Art*, Alberto Cairo gives a definition for a data visualization: "a display of data designed to enable analysis, exploration, and discovery… [They] are often conceived as tools that let people extract their own conclusions from the data." 

Through my different areas of exploration I've found myself drawn to making tools

I want to use my master's project as an opportunity to build a portfolio of data visualization work. To this end, I want to work on three different visualization efforts:
1. redesigning an exisiting visualization,
2. create a data visualization while working with someone else, and 
3. creating a self-initiated visualization




Inspired by the work of Moritz Stefaner, Lisa Strausfeld, Jan Willem Tulp, and Giorgia Lupi, I want to create these visualizations as their own individual products
