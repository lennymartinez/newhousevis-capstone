      In the 69-year history of Formula One, over 800 men have raced to be champion, but only 33 have held the cup

      But which team has had the <strong>best</strong> championship season?
    </p>


    <!-- Method 01 : Wins -->
    <h2>Method 01</h2>
    <p>
      One way to see which team had the best season is to look at the number of races they won each season
    </p>
    <div id="graph03" class="placeholder">
      lollipop plot of wins by the winning team, each of the 16 teams has a unique color that will follow us through the piece.<br>
      wins sorted from highest to lowest.
    </div>
    <p>Looking at the wins, Mercedes's 2016 run is the best season for a Formula One championship team.</p>
    <div class="placeholder2">

    </div>
    <p>
      Rosberg won the driver's cup that year and his Mercedes teammate, Lewish Hamilton was still fresh from his 2015 win.
    </p>
    <div class="placeholder2">

    </div>
    <p>
      But if we look at second place, Mercedes's 2014 run, the 2014 season had 2 less races than the 2016 season.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's two more opportunities to win a race in 2016 than in 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact if we look all the way back to the first season, 1950, there were only seven races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the same number of wins, but let's <em>normalize</em> each team's run by the number of races in that year's season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercedes's 2016 run would be:<br>
      <strong>{{latex formula of 19 wins/21 races = 0.904761905}}</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we do this for the rest of the teams we get,
    </p>
    <div id="graph04" class="placeholder">
      same lollipop as previous one, but with win percentages
    </div>
    <p>
      And if we scale everything by 100 to get percentages,
    </p>
    <div id="graph05" class="placeholder">
      scale graph04 by 100
    </div>
    <p>And we can resort them from highest to lowest win percentage:</p>
    <div id="graph06" class="placeholder">
      resort graph05 from high to low win percentage
    </div>
    <p>
      Looking at this now, Mercedes's 2016 comes in second compared to McLaren's 1988 run.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1988 McLaren's drivers, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna, got the closest to winning every race in a season.
    </p>
    <div class="placeholder2">
      pictures of Prost and Senna.
    </div>
    <p> Between the two of them, they won 15 of the 16 races. In the Italian Grand Prix that year, the only race they lost, Senna was forced to retire due to a collision on lap 49. He was leading the race from the start, and only needed 2 more laps.</p>
    <div class="placeholder2">

    <p>Behind McLaren's 1988 and Mercedes's 2016 run, is Ferrari's 2002 run. In this run, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello, split 15 wins, and 14 of them were in the very robust F2002</p>

    <!-- Method 02 : Podiums -->
    <h2>Method 02</h2>
    <p>
      @@Talk about drawbacks of looking just at wins@@
    </p>
    <p>
      What if we look at the podiums for each race? The podium refers to the first 3 places in a race.<br>
      A strong season would be one where a team got all their drivers on the podium for as many races as possible.
