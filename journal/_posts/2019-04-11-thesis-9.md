title: "Thesis 09: Decent day"
---
I'm going to do my readings and sleep after this because I have an early morning tomorrow. It was a decent day of work. I found the 1950â€“2018 dataset for F1 races from [here](http://ergast.com/mrd/). I downloaded the csv database because I'm most comfortable with CSV, but I  see value in using the API in the future for a more dynamic visualization.

Today I also finished going through the carbon counter paper and supporting info packet. They did a good job of laying out every thing they computed which will be useful for what I have in mind. I followed up with the developer of the interactive visualization to see if I can get the sample of cars and their parameters from the website. The alternative to not getting it is either building a bigger sample myself, using the 125 cars and updating prices to 2018, or abandoning the visualization.

If something didn't go great today it was setting up time boundaries and managing distractions. I need to be more direct with my family about my blocking time to do this work daily. But we'll improve.

Another thing I want to work on in the near future is to make it a habit to scan and attach my notes from the day to each of these entries.
