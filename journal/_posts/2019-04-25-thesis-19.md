title: "Thesis 19: Unproductive day"
---
Went to bed late again last night reading comics. Took grandma to her appointment today and was really tired and unproductive for the day. I ran a few errands after lunch and I did read through some or most of nadieh's projects with a focus on the sketching and some of the execution.

Did a few of the observable tutorials, but I can't seem to connect them to github so I don't particularly think they'll be as useful for what I want. I was looking for a way to combine notebooks + github to track my js work... There is a js kernel for jupyter that I may give a go, but I think working with a browser and vscode will probably be the way to go.

Still thinking about circles for the F1 driver data, but want to maybe include a version of the graphs that allows for better comparison. Will sketch tomorrow (with colors pencils) and work to move forward.

Going to bed early to be more rested for tomorrow. Might read a bit more of lifelong kindergarten, but will not be reading manga or watching netflix until I finish my thesis.

### Next Steps

1. IDVFTW chapter 11
1. Sketch ideas for F1 data
1. Look at the book of circles
