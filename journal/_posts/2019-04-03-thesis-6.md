title: "Thesis 06: I need to do better with my time"
---
I finished doing the initial data entry. I'll use this data to explore the structure and content of the piece and then take some time to update it with more recent numbers and costs.

I also ideated about the form of the story. I'll be working on it more tomorrow along with specifics from the paper.

Something successful I did today was reflect on my structure sketch and try to see how to connect it to the goal of involving more of the context into the visualizations. I didn't get to spend too much time doing it, but it's a start and I'll be building more on it tomorrow.

I feel like I write this every day but I wish I had more control of my time-- there were several hours in the day when I was doing other errands. Maybe I just need to better use the time I do have control over.
