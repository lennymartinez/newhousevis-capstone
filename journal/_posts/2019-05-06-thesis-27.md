title: "Thesis 27: good morning so far"

Had a good chat with Upton about both my master's project, and the data journalism class in the fall. I'll be updating my proposal to identify the direction I'm moving in and then in the evening I'll return to Bjarni's thesis and give feedback on a chapter. I read [chapter three](https://benfry.com/phd/dissertation/3.html) of Ben Fry's PhD presentation, [Computational Information Design](https://benfry.com/phd/dissertation/), and found it a good background on all the components that can come together to give form to data.
