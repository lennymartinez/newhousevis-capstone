        <h2>Thesis 03: Still bumpy, feeling grumpy</h2>
<p><em>I’m borrowing an idea from Lisa Rost’s thesis project: documenting my process &amp; progress on my thesis project daily. I’ll start by answering the same questions she did everyday: What have I done today? What was successful? What wasn’t? Why? What are the next steps?</em></p>

<p>I reflected on the first two chapters of The Truthful Art. You can read that <a href="https://makeinformationuseful.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/the-truthful-art-tools-for-a-fuzzy-world/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I did get to watching a talk today! I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RciU_sWYycM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Aaron Williams’ talk from OpenVis 2018</a>.</p>

<p>I didn’t get to much else. Writing about <em>The Truthful Art</em> helped me think more about how I want to structure my thesis efforts and sort things in my head, but I spent too much time today on it, and didn’t get to the actual thesis work. I need to work on my prioritization.</p>

<p>My weekend is fully of non-thesis activities and Monday doesn’t look incredibly better, but I’ll keep pushing on and re-evaluating my priorities with respect to my thesis work.</p>

<p>For next steps, I have the PDF to CSV data moving. I also need to go through the paper again and make notes on all the general pieces I’ll be arranging for the scrollytelling prototype.</p>
