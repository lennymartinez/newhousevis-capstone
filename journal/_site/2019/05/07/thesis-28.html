        <h2>Thesis 28: slow and disoriented</h2>
<p>I was working on some revisions to my proposal today, but in between doing errands with mom and dad, I ended up not doing a lot of actual work. I read through the secret Aerodynamicist’s BBC column and watched a lot of videos explaining different F1 concepts. Tomorrow I’ll finish the revised proposal, send it out, and move on to gathering info on all the cars I want to use. Or at least that’s the plan. I’ve been feeling very disoriented and slightly annoyed today.</p>
