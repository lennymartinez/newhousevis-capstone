        <h2>Thesis 23: Senna</h2>
<p>This morning I watched the documentary, Senna, that was on Netflix. I thought the whole thing was very well made with the archival footage and the different angles. I was surprised by his strong faith which doesn’t seem as noticeable today. I would watch it again.</p>

<p>Today I worked on cleaning and putting together my master results list to start doing the counting. I got as far as adding the driver info the results table. Tomorrow I’ll add the constructor and the race information. I found this whole website just now: <a href="https://www.statsf1.com/en/default.aspx">https://www.statsf1.com/en/default.aspx</a></p>

<p>It will be very useful as I check the data I have and look up information about the drivers and the cars. I’m still thinking about what the third chapter of the project will be: racetracks or an annotated timeline. Going with racetracks gives the story it’s third leg, because you already have the drivers and the cars. Making the annotated timeline would also be interesting because it’s about the intersection of the three legs: <strong>drivers</strong> <em>in</em> <strong>cars</strong> <em>on</em> <strong>racetracks</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>

<ul>
  <li>check in with AC guys</li>
  <li>get car oil changed</li>
  <li>return things at home depot</li>
  <li>finish making master results table</li>
  <li>create line charts of 1991 season</li>
  <li>Chapter 12 of IDVFTW (I need to finish the book by next Wednesday)</li>
</ul>

<p>While getting the car maintained, I’ll be reading more of the truthful art. Now I’m off to read the intro + first chapter of Eloquent Javascript. While working on my master’s I want to further imrpove my JS knowledge.</p>
