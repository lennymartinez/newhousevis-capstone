        <h2>Thesis 25: Slow Progress is still Progress.</h2>
<p>The day really flew by. I worked on my D3 prototype of the driver standings and ended the day with these three iterations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://lennymartinez.com/vis-thesis/prototype/line-chart-senna.html">Senna’s career</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lennymartinez.com/vis-thesis/prototype/line-chart-1991.html">The 1991 Season</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://lennymartinez.com/vis-thesis/prototype/line-chart-all.html">All the races</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Having all 840+ drivers is too much. But making this prototype was helpful. For this direction, I’ll move to create a list of the winners + their teammates for every season and plot this smaller subset of careers.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/lennymartinezd/status/1124352049183903745">tweeted</a> about my progress today, and how I got to the end. I’m quite happy I made such a big mess at the end, because I have a point from which I can move forward.</p>

<p>For the other direction, I should start gathering the list of all the cars I want to feature and at least make illustrations of the ones I have available (1950–2004). I’ll work on my proposal tomorrow.</p>

<p>I started watching Anthony Bourdain’s show again. I was at the start of the ninth season. Watching it reminded me of the visualization I wanted to do by looking at all the places, people, topics, and food that were involved in the show. There might be some interesting connections and commonalities across the episodes (not counting Anthony being in them).</p>
