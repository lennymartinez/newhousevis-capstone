        <h2>Thesis 24: Connecting the dots</h2>
<p>Today I finished putting together a master results table that has info on the races, the drivers, and the constructors. I made a few slices to test with: the 1991 season and Senna’s career.</p>

<p>While getting the car maintained I ran into these two pieces from fivethirtyeight:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-best-formula-one-driver-might-be-a-guy-who-hasnt-won-since-2013/">The Best Formula One Driver Might Be A Guy Who Hasn’t Won Since 2013</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/formula-one-racing/">Who’s The Best Formula One Driver Of All Time?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They made me panic because I thought the analyses were much better than what I could produce. But then I talked things through with Ron and myself and decided to focus on making 1 good piece. Ron said to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lenny make the kind of stuff you want to see yourself making in the future.<br />
Please don’t worry what will work and what won’t<br />
if you find something cool and exciting, chances are others might dig it too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While talking to Ron the thing that came to mind most vividly was the realization I had during AP World History and AP European History, that though our books were chaptered, history itself was happening simultaneously and we were going back and forth in time in this web of interconnected events. I want to make something like that with Formula 1.</p>

<p>So I’ll work on a single project and make it a good one. I couldn’t decide whether it would better to make the timeline using cars as the unit of progress/time or using the races and the drivers. I’ll be doing some small prototypes of both and then deciding on which one seems better. I think the information and some of the graphics will be transferable regardless of the direction.</p>

<p>I’ll be updating my proposal this weekend. I’m talking with Jodi on Monday. Tomorrow I’m also talking with a creative director about an internship in industrial design/product design in south florida. I’m still excited by that.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll be working on my timeline prototype with Senna’s data. I want to write my ten-year essay over the weekend or tomorrow night. I think I’m moving towards clarity, but we’ll see at the end of this process.</p>
