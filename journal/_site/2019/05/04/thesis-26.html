        <h2>Thesis 26: No work on Saturday</h2>
<p>Did nothing related to my thesis today except tidy up all the papers I had lying around my desk + shelf and open my proposal and highlight the parts I want to update. I ran errands today and felt slow, lethargic even.</p>

<p>I’m still thinking about what’s after and I’m excited to apply to CSE programs. The top schools for Computational Science and Engineering programs (ranked by <a href="https://cwur.org/2017/subjects.php#Mathematics,%20Interdisciplinary%20Applications">CWUR</a>) are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>USA</em> University of Texas at Austin</li>
  <li><em>USA</em> Stanford University</li>
  <li><em>USA</em> Northwestern University</li>
  <li><em>Spain</em> Polytechnic University of Catalonia</li>
  <li><em>USA</em> University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign</li>
  <li><em>China</em> Dalian University of Technology</li>
  <li><em>USA</em> University of California, San Diego</li>
  <li><em>USA</em> Massachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
  <li><em>Singapore</em> National University of Singapore</li>
  <li><em>Germany</em> Technical University of Munich</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these, I’m interested in UT Austin because Prof. Wilcox is there, Poytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC in Catalan/spanish), and TU Münich. MIT is interesting too, but I kind of don’t want to go there for grad school. I spent two summers in a robotics lab at UPC and I enjoyed it, so it would be nice. Münich would also be nice, I had spotted their program when looking at product design masters. It’s taught in english which is good.</p>

<p>But for now, I focus on my thesis + my upcoming course at UM. And finding a second job/internship for the fall.</p>

<p>At night I think I should spend ~2–3 hours reviewing past coursework. Something I talked about with Bjarni, but something I haven’t really started. I was thinking of starting with 18.02 and 8.01 and moving from there. He did something similar while studying for quals and said he wished he had done it earlier. I figure it works because after dinner I usually dick around and get very little done. If I channel that time to reviewing old lessons it could be a slow progress to reviewing my undergrad ahead of more technical work I want to engage in the future. Visualization is a part of it, but I do wish I could do more computational work. I did enjoy the research of that first summer at UPC.</p>

<p>I still dread learning JS. I’m doing it via D3 and I think I found a good book for JS, <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/"><em>Eloquent Javascript</em></a>, but we’ll see about the whole thing.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’m going to dad’s for lunch which should be… interesting in an interesting way. I’ll take a book with me (Maybe the truthful art, maybe minsky).</p>
