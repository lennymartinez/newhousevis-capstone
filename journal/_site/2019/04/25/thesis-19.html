        <h2>Thesis 19: Unproductive day</h2>
<p>Went to bed late again last night reading comics. Took grandma to her appointment today and was really tired and unproductive for the day. I ran a few errands after lunch and I did read through some or most of nadieh’s projects with a focus on the sketching and some of the execution.</p>

<p>Did a few of the observable tutorials, but I can’t seem to connect them to github so I don’t particularly think they’ll be as useful for what I want. I was looking for a way to combine notebooks + github to track my js work… There is a js kernel for jupyter that I may give a go, but I think working with a browser and vscode will probably be the way to go.</p>

<p>Still thinking about circles for the F1 driver data, but want to maybe include a version of the graphs that allows for better comparison. Will sketch tomorrow (with colors pencils) and work to move forward.</p>

<p>Going to bed early to be more rested for tomorrow. Might read a bit more of lifelong kindergarten, but will not be reading manga or watching netflix until I finish my thesis.</p>
