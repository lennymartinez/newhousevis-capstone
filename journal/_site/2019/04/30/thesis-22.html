        <h2>Thesis 22: Drivers, Cars, Racetracks</h2>
<p>Today I went through the tutorial, <a href="https://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/">First Python Notebook</a>, and got acquainted more with the kind of manipulations I can do with pandas. I had moved my journal to a separate repo yesterday, so I took this tutorial today to start reviewing my data cleaning/wrangling and work to get the data I want for the driver comparisons set up. My goal is to get that set up and isolate the 2018 races and get something working with Hamilton and Bottas.</p>

<p>Spoke with Bjarni this evening and he suggested complimenting the cars + driver chapters, with one on the racetracks and trying to find the best formula one track. I had been thinking of racetracks before I thought to do a visual history of the tracks, but maybe there’s something we can do with the tracks, looking at changes, seasons they were used, fatalities, races where everyone finished, or something along those lines. I need to look at the data more.</p>

<p>I’ve also started creating a draft syllabus template to start working on my journalism class. These two projects + the books I want to read should keep me occupied for the next three and a half months.</p>
