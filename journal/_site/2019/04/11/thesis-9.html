        <h2>Thesis 09: Decent day</h2>
<p>I’m going to do my readings and sleep after this because I have an early morning tomorrow. It was a decent day of work. I found the 1950–2018 dataset for F1 races from <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd/">here</a>. I downloaded the csv database because I’m most comfortable with CSV, but I  see value in using the API in the future for a more dynamic visualization.</p>

<p>Today I also finished going through the carbon counter paper and supporting info packet. They did a good job of laying out every thing they computed which will be useful for what I have in mind. I followed up with the developer of the interactive visualization to see if I can get the sample of cars and their parameters from the website. The alternative to not getting it is either building a bigger sample myself, using the 125 cars and updating prices to 2018, or abandoning the visualization.</p>

<p>If something didn’t go great today it was setting up time boundaries and managing distractions. I need to be more direct with my family about my blocking time to do this work daily. But we’ll improve.</p>

<p>Another thing I want to work on in the near future is to make it a habit to scan and attach my notes from the day to each of these entries.</p>
