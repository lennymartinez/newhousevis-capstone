        <h2>Thesis 05: Thinking about other things</h2>
<p><em>I’m borrowing an idea from Lisa Rost’s thesis project: documenting my process &amp; progress on my thesis project daily. I’ll start by answering the same questions she did everyday: What have I done today? What was successful? What wasn’t? Why? What are the next steps?</em></p>

<p>Today I worked on digitizing the data from the supporting PDF! I also read comics (I’ve transitioned from watching to re-reading Hunter x Hunter, trying to pace myself to get work done) and ran errands (afternoon traffic can be such a pain in Miami).</p>

<p>But the main focus of today was digitizing. I tried to get the data from the carboncounter website, and I tried searching on GitHub as well to see if there was a repository for the project, but nada. I started typing it out by hand in an excel file. Doing this was useful because I was able to notice more dimensions of the dataset that could be highlighted in the piece. While working on this, I’ve also been thinking about structure which I’ll start working on tomorrow.</p>

<p>Today I also spent a good bit of time thinking about what I want to do after my master’s. After my Syracuse experience and my time as a 2.009 TA, I want to step away from the storyteller path and step back on the path of a designer/engineer. I want to further develop my computation and manufacturing skills. But this is a topic for another time/journal.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll be finishing my data transferring and sketching some structure for the story, as well as coming with some initial ideas to explore in the data.</p>
