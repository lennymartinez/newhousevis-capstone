        <h2>Thesis 14: Hard fun</h2>
<p>I wrote to Mike today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Mike,<br />
I’m still waiting to hear back from the car visualization people about getting the updated data and answers to some analysis questions. I’m trying to come up with a backup for this third effort.<br />
I’ve also been looking through the Formula 1 race data from the first season in 1950 to the first three races of 2019 and have three or four ideas of interactive pieces I want to make with the data. The more I spend time with the racing data, the more room I think there is to make this piece more prominent in my work. I’ll be working to prototype the ideas statically (keynote + illustrator + paper), but I was wondering if doing two different efforts from this same base of data would work (and not doing a redesign)? Is this a question that’s more based on how I write my proposal?<br />
I’ve been thinking of about what you said of connecting my efforts with my voice. I’ve tried to figure out what “my voice” meant given that I never really stuck to any one thing, and the main thread I’ve picked on is <strong>a knack for starting with an object or an idea and through play and interaction learn more about the thing and how it connects to other things in it’s vicinity and far away</strong>. “play and interaction” can be building prototypes, talking to others, or even just pushing buttons in a new video game to learn the controls without the game instruction manual. Another way of expressing the same thread is an inclination towards “hard fun”, the idea that something is engaging and exciting and fun because it is challenging. The idea itself is explained more beautifully <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/HardFun.html">here</a> by Seymour Papert.<br />
I’ll be writing part of my proposal this week, keeping in mind that the document will grow as I hear back from Amer. Reportage and figure out the third effort. I have a few ideas for a second iteration of the work that revolves around communicating the process. I realize that the defense is public to encourage this level of communication, but I wanted to try and make sure it’s a stronger part of my project than some of the ones I’ve seen.<br />
I reached out to Jodi today, so I’m waiting to hear back from her on her availability. Let me know if you hear anything from American Reportage.</p>

<p>As I mention in the email, I think I found a way to connect my efforts: a knack for starting with an object or an idea and understanding the thing and how it connects to other things (object, ideas) in its vicinity and far away through play and interaction. Or just a desire to engage in “hard fun”. Something that really brought it together for me was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lztEnBFN5zU&amp;list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eD0M1Bfm6lvHy5BR6hoY8X&amp;index=5">video I watched last night about playground design</a> by Vox Media. Also a recent 99% invisible <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/froebels-gifts/">episode on Froeble’s gifts</a>.</p>

<p>When I was working to write my proposal two weeks ago, I kept running into a block where I could explain why I explored so many different parts of communications (photography, graphic design, VR, AR, picture editing), but I couldn’t connect that experience with why I was building data visualizations. I think the connection is to focus on making interactive things, things that people play with, use in their environment, interact with, and through that learn a little bit more about the world.</p>

<p>On the coding front, I figured out a few things today with pandas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how to work with <code class="highlighter-rouge">groupby()</code> objects</li>
  <li>how to slice a <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataFrame</code> object</li>
  <li>how to join information from two <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataFrames</code></li>
  <li>How to loop through and do some stats on <code class="highlighter-rouge">groupby()</code> objects</li>
</ul>

<p>I started sketching some of the ideas I have based on a few existing pieces:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/09/jordans/">A visual history of every Air Jordan</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rhythm-of-food.net/">Rhythm of Food</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll continue that tomorrow and try to make some static prototypes. I’ll also work on writing my proposal.</p>

<p>Outside of thesis things, I need to actively work to find a job and I need to photograph rooms in the house to put them up on AirBnb.</p>

<p>Lily sent me <a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/climb/fun-scale">this</a> article about the Fun Scale and I’d say I feel somewhere in between Type II/III fun.</p>
