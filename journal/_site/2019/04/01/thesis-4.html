        <h2>Thesis 04: No title is best title</h2>
<p><em>I’m borrowing an idea from Lisa Rost’s thesis project: documenting my process &amp; progress on my thesis project daily. I’ll start by answering the same questions she did everyday: What have I done today? What was successful? What wasn’t? Why? What are the next steps?</em></p>

<p>I got back to Miami very early today, and spent the day doing errands. In the late afternoon I started working on trying different ideas for keeping my thesis documentation separate. I decided to start with this repo, and then create a separate repository for each effort as I get to it. Before I settled on the repo, I tried to setup a jekyll blog, but couldn’t find a master structure for all the things I think would be in my documentation. I also thought of making another wordpress site, or a tumblr blog, but decided to stick with these markdown pages for simplicity. I usually draft things in Sublime Text or Bear App which are both Markdown friendly, so it makes things easier. I still don’t have a solution for a structure, but folders and files are malleable enough that over time I’ll reach something that works.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I didn’t work and instead read a little and tried to cool off. On Thursday and Friday I was getting frustrated about not getting through my whole list and over the weekend I came to more fully accept that I needed to get better at prioritizing tasks every day. Lisa read my first post today and <a href="https://twitter.com/lisacrost/status/1112599769426378752">responded to my realization that it took me more time than I anticipated</a>. She noted that I could stop doing it, and I agree. But I want to keep going because I think writing about my process is helpful for my work (I can look back later and trace a decision or a thought) and for me (writing for myself, but addressing an unknown reader keeps me sane!).</p>

<p>Tomorrow features another early morning, but I’m ready to just work on my data converting. If I get through it all tomorrow, I’ll start playing with it and seeing what it says. I’ll also be watching a rough cut of one of my classmate’s videos to give him feedback.</p>
