        <h2>Thesis 15: 111 days</h2>
<p>Today I had a fairly productive day if we don’t count thesis things. I sent out a few applications to internships. I was on the phone with Ronojoy and we talked about our master’s projects. We’re both worried but trying to make progress. I also spent an hour chatting with a former student of mine who was thinking of being a 2.009 TA next fall. I encouraged her to try it because it was a great experience and there’s room for growth and learning.</p>

<p>I also set up the rooms in Airbnb, as both single rooms, and a double room package! And it looks like we got our first bookings from next Friday to July 21.</p>

<p>I spoke to Bjarni last night about the F1 data and he suggested looking at overtakes and who does the most overtakes. Though I understand the idea I don’t know how to extract that from the data.</p>

<p>There’s also a thing I want to try with the carbon counter data: emailing trancik@mit.edu and also trying to extract the coordinates from one car from the plot and then reverse calculating things from there. If I know the x, or y, values maybe I can work out how they apply certain GREET parameters which I didn’t fully understand before.</p>

<p>Mike got back to me today:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can still define the project as best you see fit, that being the point.<br />
Creating a significant single data visualization package around Formula 1 could work. Or you could do three notable but independent efforts. Both approaches would have value but in different ways. The multiple package would point you to a professional path as someone producing such projects, the giant effort might work better for academia - it’d be like a tenure-level project.<br />
Voice comes from fully realized expressions. The process of creation forces you to realize who you are. What’s been missing is the full realization. Work to full fruition on something and your voice will emerge. I’m betting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever I first read his emails, I think he’s some sort of Jedi and that there’s a hidden wisdom in them. I need to think more about how my project is structured and scoping things down to get good things done and not get bogged in immense complexity.</p>

<p>I also got some good news today, Jodi is inclined to be on my committee. We’ll speak at the start of May so I’ve got to make progress with my proposal by then. It’s a lot of research and prep work and then it’ll be a lot of design &amp; dev work. I’m excited.</p>

<p>I think I’m more sure now than I was before about wanting to do Interactive media work. If I frame my thesis as a series of web interactives, I think things will be better!</p>
