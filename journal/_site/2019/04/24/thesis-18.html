        <h2>Thesis 18: Green light</h2>
<p>Mike gave the green light on my proposal today, so I’m moving forward with that. I think I also landed a research assistant job for the summer looking at and for startups for a report. So that’s a part-time job.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to go with the F1 data project related to finding the best driver. I went through the spreadsheets and re-organized the Ids to be more chronological. Drivers are organized by dob (Excel does not play well with dates before 1900), and races by chronological order. Everything else follows from that.</p>

<p>For this data I’ll be looking mainly at the results data that has the end results (position/points) for each of the first 1000 races. I have the data all ready, so I’m moving to the sketching part of the project. I’m trying to balance cyclical nature of a season with comparisons.</p>

<p>I’m also debating going back to R to do analysis and test visualizations because I used so little of pandas: making a dataframe, joining two dataframes. ggplot2 seems like a way to test things on a small-scale.</p>

<p>I’ve started looking at observable tutorials as well which could prove a good way to prototype and build the final visualization, to a degree.</p>

<p>I spent the morning and part of the early afternoon with grandma who had cataract surgery today. She has another appointment early tomorrow in Miramar. So that’s going to be my morning tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Look at the book of circles for ideas on F1 dataviz</li>
  <li>IDVFTW chapter 11</li>
  <li>Figure out how to use observable notebooks within a repo.</li>
  <li>Look through the data sketches projects to learn a little bit more about their sketching process.</li>
</ol>
