        <h2>Thesis 10: Do this daily</h2>
<h3 id="no-more-games">No more games</h3>

<p>There are 114 days to my defense. I finished <em>Visual Journalism</em> on Saturday and briefly looked through <em>Look Inside</em>, a book about cutaway illustrations and visual storytelling. I didn’t do a lot of work Friday when I got distracted by a Maplestory server running an older version of the MMORPG. On Saturday I played around with code and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1onTATthutM_DhWkgZ8ZvwGjis6mcbFcx">brute-forced some geometric patterns on a 2x2 grid</a>. I split a square canvas into a 2x2 grid and go through and try every combination of 9 patterns for each square. I’ve been trying to do the same thing on a 3x3 grid, but there are too many possibilities (387,420,489) and I’ve been restarting the process while tweaking the canvas size to balance image quality and amount of memory each mage takes. Yesterday I was running errands and I watched Game of Thrones.</p>

<p>My goals for this week are to work on my formula 1 project, prepare a rough outline of my proposal, and confirm my committee (I need to reach out to one more person).</p>

<h3 id="a-new-tool">A new tool</h3>

<p>In working and procrastinating, I’ve hit a point where I’m very much aware there’s nothing left for me to waste time on so I get back to work. It’s a weird feeling as I’m very much used to just wasting time, and then pulling out a draft/object/thing at the last second that scrapes by, but I’m trying to better embrace it. Yesterday this feeling drove me to look more at how I’d work with the F1 data and I realized I should learn a tool to work with relational data.</p>

<p>I was originally thinking of learning SQL, but in trying to pick between MySQL and PostgreSQL, and then working to set something up, I just got really overwhelmed. Looking at alternatives I realized I could learn R and the tidyverse or learn more python packages (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) to do these kinds of things. I talked to Ali (he suggested python), I talked to Anna (she ended up sending me the link to Renee’s website by sharing <a href="https://therstudio.com">therstudio.com</a> thinking it was related to Rstudio), and I couldn’t get a hold of Bjarni (he was out with his mom who’s visiting). I tweeted and asked on the News Nerdery Slack, and people suggested R. I spent around three hours trying to decide which one to learn because it’ll affect my next job. This fall I’ll be teaching an intro to data journalism class at UM and after we get through excel, the goal is to teach a more programmatic approach to analyzing data and the options I’ve been thinking of are R (data journalists like it a lot!) and python (I know how it works! sort of).</p>

<h3 id="formula-1">Formula 1</h3>

<p>I’ve started mapping the different tables to see what connects what. In the formula 1 dataset, we have 3 general categories of data: driver data, constructor data, and race data. And they’re all inter related. <strong>Drivers race cars built by constructors to see who is the best over the course of a series of races.</strong> Thinking of what I want to present with this work, I can only envision a summary explorer, but I think analysis can help point me out. Right now I have data for the first 997 races (1950-2018 seasons), but I want to include the first races of 2019, at least the first 3, to hit the 1000 races mark. I am also considering adding the races up to the summer break which coincides with my defense (the Hungarian GP is 4 August).</p>

<p>In thinking of communicating the data I am reminded of some of Accurat’s work in <em>La Lettura</em> and how the data is thickly layered in a grand architecture. Maybe this project will turn out like that.</p>

<p>On Monday I got through half of chapter 3 of <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">#R4DS</a>, and then the rest of my day doing errands.</p>
