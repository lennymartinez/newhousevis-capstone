        <h2>Thesis 12: Not the set out path, but progress!</h2>
<p>I was going through the #R4DS book and then decided to switch over to pandas and python. I completed some tutorials, and read through documentation and started playing around with F1 data. I set out to see how many podiums (1st, 2nd, or 3rd places) Hamilton has gotten in his career so far. I got the answer (136 based on the data I had previously downloaded) and then learned that the data I had included the first two 2019 races, so I went ahead and updated the data and now it’s 137 podiums and I have a full 1000 races worth of data. I did some cleaning to get rid of how the null cells had been labeled and changed the date format so it would be easier to read.</p>

<p>Some things I have to still look into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Going from getting Hamilton’s podiums, to getting the podiums of all the drivers. I started with making a function to get the P-n for all the n values.</li>
  <li>looking into doing DataFrame level operations instead of looping things. I’m more used to looping things and creating custom csv cuts to feed into graphics, but I think I need a different approach for these interactive graphics.</li>
</ul>
