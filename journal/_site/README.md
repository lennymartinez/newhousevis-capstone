# NewhouseVIS Thesis Journal

This is the sketchbook/journal for my MS thesis project. I left Syracuse at the end of the Spring 2018 semester and started and killed various repos as I try and decide on a master's project. On 27 April 2019, I set a final course to create a single well-designed data visualization piece worthy of being published by The Pudding. So that's the goal now!
