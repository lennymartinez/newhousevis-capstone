		<h1>The Best Formula One Team</h1>
		<p>In the 69-year history of the sport, over 800 men and 5 women have raced to win the Driver's Cup, but only <strong>33</strong> drivers have held it.</p>
		<p class="tbd">Packed bubble chart of drivers. maybe make in illustrator</p>
		<p>These 33 drivers have all won while racing for 16 different teams:</p>
		<p class="tbd">stacked dot plot of championship wins by team or team bar chart; maybe make in illustrator</p>
		<p>Which of these teams had the <em>best championship season</em>?</p>

	<section id="wins">
		<h2>Method 01: Most wins in season</h2>
		<p>One way to look for the best championship season is to compare how many races each constructor's drivers won in their championship runs. In Formula One, as in other racing sports, finishing first is the holy grail. The best championship run for a constructor would be one where their team wins every race.</p>
		<h3>Methodology</h3>
		<p>For each season:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Find the driver that won the year's Driver's Cup.</li>
			<li>Look at what constructor he was driving for</li>
			<li>See how many races the constructor's drivers finished first in.</li>
			<li>Divide by the number of races in the season to get the percentage of races won.</li>
		</ol>
		<section class="tbd">
			<p>Turn this into a lollipop chart or a bar chart; consider switching between wins and win percentage</p>
