	<h2>Setup</h2>
	<p>In the first 69 years of Formula One, over 800 drivers (5 women, the rest men) have raced to win the World Driver's Cup. Of these 800+ drivers, only 33 have won.</p>
	<p>These 33 men have all raced for 16 different teams/constructors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Ferrari</li>
		<li>McLaren</li>
		<li>Williams</li>
		<li>Mercedes</li>
		<li>Lotus</li>
		<li>Red Bull</li>
		<li>Brabham</li>
		<li>Renault</li>
		<li>Cooper</li>
		<li>Benetton</li>
		<li>Tyrrell</li>
		<li>Alfa Romeo</li>
		<li>Maserati</li>
		<li>BRM</li>
		<li>Matra</li>
		<li>Brawn GP</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each season, the constructors design and build cars for their drivers to use in a series of races. Constructors are the people who design and build the car chassis. They don't all necessarily manufacture their own engines for their cars.</p>
	<p>In the early years of Formula One, constructors also supplied chassis to different entrants and smaller teams, while usually also having a team of their own. This makes a slight difficulty in counting individual teams, but I'm handling it by focusing on the constructors, regardless of engine or whether they were an independent entrant or the official team.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Question/Goal</h2>
	<p>I want to answer the question: <strong>Which constructor had the <em>best</em> championship season?</strong></p>
	<p>To answer this question, I'm looking at three different ways of defining "best":</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Most wins</li>
		<li>Most podium finishes</li>
		<li>Closest to perfect</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Data Sources</h2>
	<p>In trying to answer this question I needed data about race finishes</p>
	<h3>Ergast Developer API</h3>
	<p>@@</p>
	<h3>formula1.com</h3>
	<p>This is the archival results for Formula 1 races hosted by the FIA. I built a few scrapers to get the race results for all the races, as well as the winning constructor for each year.</p>
	<p>For any page in their results section, the main table is identified by the table with class ".resultsarchive-table".</p>
	<h3>statsf1.com</h3>

	<h2>Methods</h2>
	<h3>Most wins</h3>
	<h3>Most podium finishes</h3>
	<h3>Closest to perfect</h3>
