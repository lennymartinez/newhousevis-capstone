    "# Cleaning f1db data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is to clean the series of csv tables coming from the [Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/db/). I'm downloading the raw csv tables and processing them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note about the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The tables are not chronologically organized in most cases. Races seem to start around Hamilton's debut with McLaren. Part of my initial cleaning and preparation is to get this re-organized to be chonrological.\n",
    "* In the standings table, a new entry is not added after a race if the driver does not change standings.\n",
    "* When a cell is `\\N` it means the cell is null, or the value wasn't recorded. This largely applies to things for which we had no data in the beginning.\n",
    "* Looking at the original `raceId`, something happened because Azerbaijan GP 2019 was the 1001st race but their id for the same race was 1013. I assume the counting was pushed ahead somewhere in the middle, but things are still okay.\n",
    "* The `drivers` table is actually named `driver.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**I last downloaded this data on 19-06-10.**"
